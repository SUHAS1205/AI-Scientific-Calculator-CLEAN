# AI Scientific Calculator

---

## Project Overview

AI Scientific Calculator is a web-based tool that leverages AI to interpret natural language math queries via **text or voice**, performing advanced computations such as **calculus, algebra, matrices, and statistics** using OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini.

---

## Key Features

- Natural language and voice input support  
  *(e.g., “Integrate sin(x) from 0 to 4”)* using Web Speech API for hands-free usage.

- Secure user authentication  
  Login and registration with personalized history tracking stored in a MySQL database.

- Real-time intelligent results  
  Text-to-speech output with higher flexibility and accuracy than traditional calculators.
